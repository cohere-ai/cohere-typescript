The latter is the only one we haven\u2019t study so far. It took 15 years and Adele to break their record of 2,4 million units sold of No Strings Attached in its first week alone.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of the Soundscan era prior 2015, was also theirs since Celebrity debuted with 1,88 million units sold.",

If Jonas Brothers and more recently One Direction reached a great level of popularity during the past decade, the type of success achieved by Backstreet Boys is in a completely different level as they really dominated the business for a few years all over the world, including in some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for Western artists.\n\nWe will try to analyze the extent of that hegemony with this new article with final results which will more than surprise many readers.",
